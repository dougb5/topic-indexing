# This configuration file is used within a system that indexes text documents
# by subject in a semi-supervised way for use in a corpus browsing tool.
# To use it, first determine a set of broad topics relevant to your corpus,
# and then hand-curate a few seed terms (words and multi-word compounds) for
# each topic.  Specify the topics and seed terms in this file and then run
# ./generate_topics_terms.py to generate an expanded set of topic terms.
# The output of that script can then be used by downstream analysis scripts
# to organize the corpus by topic, or make a topic-guided search interface.
#
# Each topic has the following configuration attributes:
#
#   id:  identifier for this topic
#   display_name:  how the name of the topic should be displayed
#   values:  List of terms in the hand-curated "seed set" for this topic
#     Each term in this list is guaranteed to appear in the expanded set, plus
#     any expansions.  (For expansions to be generated, this term must be in
#     the vocabulary of the word2vec model used by ./generate_topics_terms.py)
#   values_file:  If specified, get the list of values from a file instead
#   softmatch_min_similarity_any:  (float) expand the set to include terms that have
#     at least this cosine similarity (in a word2vec model) with any of the values
#   softmatch_min_similarity_mean:  (float) Also include terms that have at least
#     this mean-squared cosine similarity with all of the values
#   max_to_add:  (int) for the softmatch options, add no more than this many new terms

# The example configuration below was used for organizing the community-focused
# conversations of the Local Voices Network.
